						<h1>Welcome</h1>

						<p>Dear friends and members of the Mormon Transhumanist Association,</p>

<p>2014 was a strong year for our Association, which has grown to nearly 500 members, and continues to be the world's largest advocacy network for the ethical use of technology and religion to extend human abilities. As you'll see in this annual report, we've been busy connecting, discussing, conferencing, and serving. Thank you, all, for the many ways you've each contributed and supported.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the year, for me, was the 2014 Conference. I enjoyed sharing with you the diverse perspectives of Mormon Transhumanists, listening to excellent presentations from Mormon philosopher Adam Miller and Transhumanist designer Natasha Vita-More, and engaging many of you personally in fascinating and inspiring discussion. Now the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/2015-conference-of-the-mormon-transhumanist-association-registration-15677843853">2015 Conference</a> is just around the corner. Keynotes will be <a href="http://news.transfigurism.org/2015/03/kristine-haglund-mormon-essayist-to.html">Mormon essayist Kristine Haglund</a> and <a href="http://news.transfigurism.org/2015/03/ralph-merkle-transhumanist-technologist.html">Transhumanist technologist Ralph Merkle</a>. Hope to see you there!</p>

<p>Another highlight was the launch, at year's end, of an official blog for the Association. <a href="http://www.transfigurist.org/">The Transfigurist</a> is an extraordinary exploration of science, religion, technology, and spirituality, with emphasis on Mormonism and Transhumanism. The authors are remarkable, sharp-minded and big-hearted. Check out their work. Submit your own. And if you haven't already, <a href="http://www.transfigurist.org/p/subscribe.html">subscribe</a> today!</p>

<p>Maybe the coolest development of the year was the Association's increased emphasis on humanitarian applications of technology. Our humanitarian managers, Hank Pellissier and Roger Hansen, inspired many of us to do a bit more than we have before to contribute to globalizing the benefits of technology. You can read <a href="#uganda-project" data-scroll data-speed="1000" data-easing="easeInOutCubic" data-url="true">more about</a> the <a href="#philanthropy" data-scroll data-speed="1000" data-easing="easeInOutCubic" data-url="true">details</a> later in this report.</p>

<p>These are challenging times. Rapidly changing and decentralizing technology is stretching traditional cultures and disrupting social norms. Religious fundamentalists are globalizing their escapist and nihilistic doctrines, stifling human aspiration with oppressive theologies, and gathering recruits to their violent causes. Anti-religious zealots are escalating small-minded ridicule and reductionist esthetics that would shame humanity away from our greatest hopes for compassion and creation beyond present notions of suffering and death.</p>

<p>I'm encouraged by the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and by the Mormon and Transhumanist principles that motivate more immersive and practical understandings of that Gospel. I'm also encouraged by you, and by our Association. Your personal stories of change, overcoming disillusionment and expanding minds and provoking action, together reinforce my confidence in a better world. It would be difficult to exaggerate how much I value that. Thank you.</p>

						<ol>
							<li>We seek the spiritual and physical exaltation of individuals and their anatomies, as well as communities and their environments, according to their wills, desires and laws, to the extent they are not oppressive.</li>
							<li>We believe that scientific knowledge and technological power are among the means ordained of God to enable such exaltation, including realization of diverse prophetic visions of transfiguration, immortality, resurrection, renewal of this world, and the discovery and creation of worlds without end.</li>
							<li>We feel a duty to use science and technology according to wisdom and inspiration, to identify and prepare for risks and responsibilities associated with future advances, and to persuade others to do likewise.</li>

				 		<h1>Performance Review</h1>
             <p>March 11, 2015</p>

             <p><em>In the interest of ongoing transparency, the Board of Directors of the Mormon Transhumanist Association is pleased to release the following leadership performance review. Each member of the Board independently evaluated the performance of the Board as a whole and the performance of CEO Lincoln Cannon, who is appointed by the Board to manage the Association. Secretary of the Board, Dorothy Deasy, gathered and compiled the evaluations into a single review, which follows.</em></p>

             <h2>Board of Directors Performance Review</h2>
             <p>The Board of Directors of the Mormon Transhumanist Association is generally performing its function well. It is comprised of intelligent and compassionate people, who provide good counsel to management on request. It consists of independent, creative, mostly academically-trained thinkers who are able to work together respectfully and articulately toward a consensus on vision, strategy, and policy. There is a diversity of perspectives, including gender, faiths, and sexual orientations, while being able to achieve a unity of directional vision. The Board performs its functions efficiently, with the ability to respectfully and productively disagree, bringing cohesive leadership to the Association.</p>
             <p>This past year, the organization restructured roles, delegating task completion to domain managers. This shifted the focus of the board to be strategic rather than tactical, relieving some time-pressure burdens. The Board is still feeling its way through the transition to produce improved strategic output. This past year the Board established a Humanitarian Projects committee (led by Hank Pellissier and Roger Hansen), developed a policy for moderating discussion forums, worked on guidelines for partnering with other religious transhumanist organizations, began work on a website refresh, and organized an annual conference with strong keynote speakers.</p>
             <p>A key goal for the Board moving forward is to bring clarity and commitment to the strategy-setting role. The Board needs to consider more objective ways of defining and measuring its performance and improvement over time. Another key objective is to better involve and mentor other members of the Association in activities so as to develop leadership for the future.</p>
             <p>The Board meets on a monthly basis. Most Board members attend board meetings regularly. (There are periods of time when scheduling conflicts arise, resulting in some occasional or partial attendance, but we have fairly consistently achieved the quorum required by the constitution.) Meetings are always well organized and focused, and action items are always noted and followed up on until they are completed or reprioritized. The Board adheres closely to the rules and guidelines established by the constitution to ensure fairness, transparency, and fidelity to the stated goals of the Association.</p>
             <p>The requirements of the Board are flexible enough to be satisfied by the part-time involvement of each member, without financial compensation. The Board has done a good job of crafting and supporting Association initiatives on a voluntary basis.</p>

             <h2>CEO's Performance Review</h2>
             <p>Lincoln Cannon is both an inspiring leader and an organized manager. He leads by sharing a vision and then taking practical and consistent steps to carry it out. Lincoln balances near-term goals with ones that are more long-term and speculative. He has a talent for "thinking big" and recognizing the broader implications of current trends. Lincoln excels at thought leadership. He has a gift for articulating complex ideas in ways that are inspiring and easy to understand. He is the public face of the Association and the driving force behind its continued existence, leadership, vision, and passion.</p>
             <p>Lincoln leads by example. He is open and encourages divergent points of view. He is comfortable with ambiguity and nuance. He strives to move people beyond &#8220;black and white&#8221; thinking. As the Association is best served by finding common ground between potentially antagonistic world views, this element of Lincoln's perspective is valuable for the Association. He attempts to weave a middle way through all conflicts.</p>
             <p>As some of the speculative issues related to transhumanism begin to materialize in society, Lincoln may be increasingly challenged to navigate Directors&#8217; viewpoints on ethical issues.</p>
             <p>Some highlights of his leadership include:</p>
             <ul><li>Beginning an effort to identify management partners/successors</li>
             <li>Continued effort to separate strategic role of directors from implementation role of managers</li>
             <li>Ensuring Directors have meaningful responsibilities for which they can be accountable</li>
             <li>Reaching out to prominent leaders of complementary organizations</li>
             <li>Public outreach and publication/presentation to non-Association audiences</li>
             <li>He is the public face of the Association and the driving force behind its continued existence leadership, vision, and passion</li></ul>
             <p>Lincoln&#8217;s key strengths include:</p>
             <ul><li>Vision</li>
             <li>Organization</li>
             <li>Articulate</li>
             <li>Inspirational</li>
             <li>A &#8220;bridge builder,&#8221; able to facilitate relationships</li>
             <li>Patience</li>
             <li>Encouragement</li>
             <li>Strategic, &#8220;big picture&#8221; and long-view perspectives</li>
             </ul>

            <p>February 11</p>
            <p>The Mormon Transhumanist Association joined a broad coalition of activist groups, companies, and online platforms to hold a worldwide day of activism in opposition to the NSA's mass spying regime.</p>

            <p>Dubbed "<a href="https://thedaywefightback.org/">The Day We Fight Back</a>," the day of activism was announced on the eve of the anniversary of the tragic passing of activist and technologist Aaron Swartz. The protest was both in his honor and in celebration of the victory over the Stop Online Piracy Act two years prior, which he helped spur.

            <p>March 1</p>

            <p>Continuing an annual tradition, members and friends of the association celebrated Future Day, March 1, by gathering for lunch at Thanksgiving Point Tower Deli in Lehi, Utah. </p>
            <p>Future Day was first celebrated in 2012 as a way of focusing and celebrating the energy that more and more people around the world are directing toward creating a radically better future. For members of the Mormon Transhumanist Association, this is a great opportunity to share thoughts and questions about a future of radical flourishing in compassion and creation through technology and religion.</p>

            <h1>Atheists &amp; Mormons: Exposing Myths, Dispelling Stereotypes</h1>
            <p>April 16</p>

						<p>The association sponsored the recording of a panel discussion on "<a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezjGfdeZG4g&list=PLbIPMPVrfXYBb1LymKOZhc9b9Dky0yWuS&index=6">Atheists &amp; Mormons: Exposing Myths, Dispelling Stereotypes</a>," a free public event in the Nancy Tessman Auditorium at the Salt Lake City Public Library, and made the recording available to the public for free on its <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezjGfdeZG4g&list=PLbIPMPVrfXYBb1LymKOZhc9b9Dky0yWuS&index=6">YouTube channel</a>.<br />
						
						<p>The panel discussion was organized by the American Atheists and was moderated by Dr. Paul Reeve of the University of Utah. Panelists included Brigham Young University professors J. B. Haws and Richard Holzapfel; American Atheists president David Silverman; and author Joanne Hanks. The panel addressed public perceptions of atheists and Mormons, tackling common stereotypes of both groups, dispelling myths, and answering audience questions.</p>
												
						<p>Silverman stated that the purpose of the panel was to challenge how atheists and religious people think of each other. "A better understanding of where we're all coming from is needed to share political and social space. We're happy to hear that both sides want to close that gap and are willing to take part in doing so."</p>

						<p>The panel was a "warm-up" event for the American Atheists National Convention, held the next day at the Hilton Salt Lake City Center.</p>

            <h1>MTA responds to charges of apostasy against Kate Kelly and John Dehlin</h1>
            <p>June 18</p>

            <p>The Board of Directors of The Mormon Transhumanist Association released an <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/230209527/Reconcile-the-Members-of-the-Body-of-Christ">official statement</a> in response to the charges of apostasy raised by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints against Kate Kelly of Ordain Women and John Dehlin of Mormon Stories.</p>

            <p>"Recent events present a crucial opportunity," the statement reads, "both for the LDS Church and for Mormons who dissent from mainstream views, to reinforce precedent for reconciliation and atonement. The MTA encourages all involved in or affected by these events to think of and pray for each other, and to avoid actions that would harm each other, weaken families and friendships, or further polarize or homogenize our religion. Compassion, genuinely informed by and concerned for each other's interests, is our best way forward."</p>

            <p>The full statement may be viewed on <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/230209527/Reconcile-the-Members-of-the-Body-of-Christ">Scribd</a> and on the <a href="http://news.transfigurism.org/2014/06/reconcile-members-of-body-of-christ.html">association website</a>.</p>

            <p><i>Although the Mormon Transhumanist Association is not affiliated with any of these organizations, most MTA members are also members of the LDS Church, and some MTA members have strong differing opinions about these events.</i><p>

            <h1>MTA announces project to alleviate poverty in Uganda</h1>
            <p>September 16</p>

            <p>The Mormon Transhumanist Association, led by Association members Hank Pellissier and Roger Hansen, is dedicating itself to the cause of alleviating poverty in Uganda, where <a href="http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/640813-67-of-ugandans-vulnerable-to-poverty.html">67% of Ugandans</a> live below the poverty line, 24.7% are trapped in extreme poverty, and <a href="http://a-childs-voice.org/how-many-orphans-are-in-uganda/">2.5 million children are orphans</a>, largely due to AIDS.</p>

            <p>Hank Pellissier is the founder of Transhumanity.net and ImmortalLife.info, and author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Invent-Utopia-Transhumanist-Suggestions-Pre-Singularity-ebook/dp/B00JL4P5I8"><i>Invent Utopia Now: Transhumanist suggestions for the pre-Singularity era</i></a>. He has worked as a professional journalist for many years, writing columns and feature articles for NYTimes, Salon.com, SFGate.com, GreatSchools.org, and other publications. He has been a member of the Mormon Transhumanist Association for nearly three years.</p>
            <p>Although an atheist, Hank says he is fond of the MTA because it has been extraordinarily generous in his charity drives. When he was Managing Director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technology (IEET) in 2012, he launched a cell phone drive for IEET's <a href="http://ieet.org/index.php/ieet/africa">African Futures Project</a>, and MTA members contributed 40% of the total collected mobiles (thanks to Roger Hansen's efforts). Hank also admires the association's <a href="http://www.kiva.org/team/transfigurism">KIVA team</a> that has existed since January 2013, with 19 members contributing 93 loans. He praised the association's KIVA activity in his essay, "<a href="http://transhumanity.net/transhumanist-philanthropy-yes-mta-sets-up-kiva-account/">Transhumanist Philanthropy?! Yes! MTA Sets up KIVA Account</a>."</p>
					
						<p>Roger Hansen is an MTA member who has done extensive volunteer work in Uganda, setting up solar energy systems, clean water systems, and children's playgrounds. He is soon retiring from his position as Planning Group Chief for the Bureau of Reclamation in Provo, Utah. Roger maintains a blog called <a href="http://rogerdhansen.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/southern-uganda-fun-with-the-pentacostals/">Tired Road Warrior</a> that often relates his thoughts and experiences regarding Uganda. "I live part-time in Uganda and in Navajoland," Roger writes, "and would like to see the human and ecological environment in both areas of world greatly improved. ... [I am] less excited about life extension (a transhumanist obsession) than I am about the possibilities of using technology to improve conditions in developing countries. [I have] A belief that technology is one potential savior for the developing world, particularly in areas like Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia."<p>

				 		<h1>Philanthropy</h1>
				 		<p>Members of association contributed generously to charity campaigns in Uganda that were conducted by Roger Hansen and Hank Pellissier, managers of MTA humanitarian projects. They also provided funding for several KIVA microloans.<br />
				 		<br/>
						<b>Uganda Orphanage Chicken Farm</b><br/> <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/Eggs-For-Orphans---Uganda">http://www.gofundme.com/Eggs-For-Orphans---Uganda</a><br />
						This campaign was extremely successful. In two months, $3,100 was raised to build a chicken farm of 200 chickens to help an orphanage in Jinja achieve self-sufficiency.  The MTA was the largest contributor to this campaign. MTA members donated about $1,100. The Chicken Farm appears headed for success - the chickens will be laying eggs in about 5 weeks.<br />
						<br />
						<b>Uganda Carpentry Workshop for AIDS Orphans</b><br/><a href="http://funds.gofundme.com/dashboard/orphan-carpenters">http://funds.gofundme.com/dashboard/orphan-carpenters</a><br />
						This successful campaign raised $1,073. It was almost entirely funded by MTA members; MTA members donated about $835. The money purchased tools for the carpenters. They are very grateful. Hank Pellissier has been invited to give the commencement speech at their graduation ceremony on January 17th. He will thank MTA contributors in his presentation.<br />
						<br />
						<b>Kikoy Dresses for Uganda Orphans</b> <br/><a href="http://funds.gofundme.com/dashboard/orphangirls">http://funds.gofundme.com/dashboard/orphangirls</a><br />
