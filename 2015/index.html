						<h1>Welcome</h1>

						<p>Dear friends and members of the Mormon Transhumanist Association,</p>

<p>2015 was a strong year for our Association, which has grown to nearly 500 members, and continues to be the world's largest advocacy network for the ethical use of technology and religion to extend human abilities. As you'll see in this annual report, we've been busy connecting, discussing, conferencing, and serving. Thank you, all, for the many ways you've each contributed and supported.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the year, for me, was the 2015 Conference. I enjoyed sharing with you the diverse perspectives of Mormon Transhumanists, listening to excellent presentations from Mormon philosopher Adam Miller and Transhumanist designer Natasha Vita-More, and engaging many of you personally in fascinating and inspiring discussion. Now the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/2015-conference-of-the-mormon-transhumanist-association-registration-15677843853">2015 Conference</a> is just around the corner. Keynotes will be <a href="http://news.transfigurism.org/2015/03/kristine-haglund-mormon-essayist-to.html">Mormon essayist Kristine Haglund</a> and <a href="http://news.transfigurism.org/2015/03/ralph-merkle-transhumanist-technologist.html">Transhumanist technologist Ralph Merkle</a>. Hope to see you there!</p>

<p>Another highlight was the launch, at year's end, of an official blog for the Association. <a href="http://www.transfigurist.org/">The Transfigurist</a> is an extraordinary exploration of science, religion, technology, and spirituality, with emphasis on Mormonism and Transhumanism. The authors are remarkable, sharp-minded and big-hearted. Check out their work. Submit your own. And if you haven't already, <a href="http://www.transfigurist.org/p/subscribe.html">subscribe</a> today!</p>

<p>Maybe the coolest development of the year was the Association's increased emphasis on humanitarian applications of technology. Our humanitarian managers, Hank Pellissier and Roger Hansen, inspired many of us to do a bit more than we have before to contribute to globalizing the benefits of technology. You can read <a href="#uganda-project" data-scroll data-speed="1000" data-easing="easeInOutCubic" data-url="true">more about</a> the <a href="#philanthropy" data-scroll data-speed="1000" data-easing="easeInOutCubic" data-url="true">details</a> later in this report.</p>

<p>These are challenging times. Rapidly changing and decentralizing technology is stretching traditional cultures and disrupting social norms. Religious fundamentalists are globalizing their escapist and nihilistic doctrines, stifling human aspiration with oppressive theologies, and gathering recruits to their violent causes. Anti-religious zealots are escalating small-minded ridicule and reductionist esthetics that would shame humanity away from our greatest hopes for compassion and creation beyond present notions of suffering and death.</p>

<p>I'm encouraged by the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and by the Mormon and Transhumanist principles that motivate more immersive and practical understandings of that Gospel. I'm also encouraged by you, and by our Association. Your personal stories of change, overcoming disillusionment and expanding minds and provoking action, together reinforce my confidence in a better world. It would be difficult to exaggerate how much I value that. Thank you.</p>

							<li>We believe that scientific knowledge and technological power are among the means ordained of God to enable such exaltation, including realization of diverse prophetic visions of transfiguration, immortality, resurrection, renewal of this world, and the discovery and creation of worlds without end.</li>

				 		<h1>Performance Review</h1>
             <p>March 11, 2015</p>

             <p><em>In the interest of ongoing transparency, the Board of Directors of the Mormon Transhumanist Association is pleased to release the following leadership performance review. Each member of the Board independently evaluated the performance of the Board as a whole and the performance of CEO Lincoln Cannon, who is appointed by the Board to manage the Association. Secretary of the Board, Dorothy Deasy, gathered and compiled the evaluations into a single review, which follows.</em></p>

             <h2>Board of Directors Performance Review</h2>
             <p>The Board of Directors of the Mormon Transhumanist Association is generally performing its function well. It is comprised of intelligent and compassionate people, who provide good counsel to management on request. It consists of independent, creative, mostly academically-trained thinkers who are able to work together respectfully and articulately toward a consensus on vision, strategy, and policy. There is a diversity of perspectives, including gender, faiths, and sexual orientations, while being able to achieve a unity of directional vision. The Board performs its functions efficiently, with the ability to respectfully and productively disagree, bringing cohesive leadership to the Association.</p>
             <p>This past year, the organization restructured roles, delegating task completion to domain managers. This shifted the focus of the board to be strategic rather than tactical, relieving some time-pressure burdens. The Board is still feeling its way through the transition to produce improved strategic output. This past year the Board established a Humanitarian Projects committee (led by Hank Pellissier and Roger Hansen), developed a policy for moderating discussion forums, worked on guidelines for partnering with other religious transhumanist organizations, began work on a website refresh, and organized an annual conference with strong keynote speakers.</p>
             <p>A key goal for the Board moving forward is to bring clarity and commitment to the strategy-setting role. The Board needs to consider more objective ways of defining and measuring its performance and improvement over time. Another key objective is to better involve and mentor other members of the Association in activities so as to develop leadership for the future.</p>
             <p>The Board meets on a monthly basis. Most Board members attend board meetings regularly. (There are periods of time when scheduling conflicts arise, resulting in some occasional or partial attendance, but we have fairly consistently achieved the quorum required by the constitution.) Meetings are always well organized and focused, and action items are always noted and followed up on until they are completed or reprioritized. The Board adheres closely to the rules and guidelines established by the constitution to ensure fairness, transparency, and fidelity to the stated goals of the Association.</p>
             <p>The requirements of the Board are flexible enough to be satisfied by the part-time involvement of each member, without financial compensation. The Board has done a good job of crafting and supporting Association initiatives on a voluntary basis.</p>

             <h2>CEO's Performance Review</h2>
             <p>Lincoln Cannon is both an inspiring leader and an organized manager. He leads by sharing a vision and then taking practical and consistent steps to carry it out. Lincoln balances near-term goals with ones that are more long-term and speculative. He has a talent for "thinking big" and recognizing the broader implications of current trends. Lincoln excels at thought leadership. He has a gift for articulating complex ideas in ways that are inspiring and easy to understand. He is the public face of the Association and the driving force behind its continued existence, leadership, vision, and passion.</p>
             <p>Lincoln leads by example. He is open and encourages divergent points of view. He is comfortable with ambiguity and nuance. He strives to move people beyond &#8220;black and white&#8221; thinking. As the Association is best served by finding common ground between potentially antagonistic world views, this element of Lincoln's perspective is valuable for the Association. He attempts to weave a middle way through all conflicts.</p>
             <p>As some of the speculative issues related to transhumanism begin to materialize in society, Lincoln may be increasingly challenged to navigate Directors&#8217; viewpoints on ethical issues.</p>
             <p>Some highlights of his leadership include:</p>
             <ul><li>Beginning an effort to identify management partners/successors</li>
             <li>Continued effort to separate strategic role of directors from implementation role of managers</li>
             <li>Ensuring Directors have meaningful responsibilities for which they can be accountable</li>
             <li>Reaching out to prominent leaders of complementary organizations</li>
             <li>Public outreach and publication/presentation to non-Association audiences</li>
             <li>He is the public face of the Association and the driving force behind its continued existence leadership, vision, and passion</li></ul>
             <p>Lincoln&#8217;s key strengths include:</p>
             <ul><li>Vision</li>
             <li>Organization</li>
             <li>Articulate</li>
             <li>Inspirational</li>
             <li>A &#8220;bridge builder,&#8221; able to facilitate relationships</li>
             <li>Patience</li>
             <li>Encouragement</li>
             <li>Strategic, &#8220;big picture&#8221; and long-view perspectives</li>
             </ul>

            <p>March 1</p>

            <p>Members and friends of the association celebrated Future Day by gathering for a screening of <em>AI: Artificial Intelligence</em> at the home of Nathan and Molly Hadfield in Provo, Utah.</p>

            <p>Future Day was first celebrated in 2012 as a way of focusing and celebrating the energy that more and more people around the world are directing toward creating a radically better future. For members of the Mormon Transhumanist Association, this is a great opportunity to share thoughts and questions about a future of radical flourishing in compassion and creation through technology and religion.</p>

            <h1><em>Theology and Science</em> publishes "What is Mormon Transhumanism?"</h1>

            <p>April 17</p>
            <p>The peer reviewed Journal <em>Theology and Science</em> has published "<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14746700.2015.1023992">What is Mormon Transhumanism?</a>" The article was written by Lincoln Cannon, president of the Mormon Transhumanist Association. An abstract of the article follows:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Mormon transhumanism is the idea that humanity should learn how to be compassionate creators. This idea is essential to Mormonism, which provides a religious framework consistent with naturalism and supportive of human transformation. Mormon transhumanists are not limited to traditional or popular accounts of religion, and embrace opportunities and risks of technological evolution. Although usually considered secular, transhumanism has some religious origins and sometimes functions as religion. Accelerating change contextualizes a Mormon transhumanist narrative of common expectations, aspirations, and parallels between Mormonism and transhumanism. Mormon transhumanism has produced secular arguments for faith in God and religious arguments for transhumanism.</p>

            <h1>Religous anthropologist launches study of Mormon Transhumanist Association</h1>
            <p>May 30</p>
            <p>Religious anthropologist <a href="http://jonbialecki.co">Jon Bialecki</a> has launched a study of the Mormon Transhumanist Association, with support of Association leadership. We invite members, friends, critics, and observers of the Association to contribute by welcoming Jon to related discussions and events. You may direct questions to <a href="maito:Jon.Bialecki@ed.ac.uk">Jon</a> or to <a href="mailto:admin@transfigurism.org">Association leadership</a>. Below is a letter of introduction from Jon.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Hello, members of the Mormon Transhumanist Association! I’d like to introduce myself, and also explain why such an introduction might be necessary.</p>

              <p>My name is Jon Bialecki, and I’m a lecturer in Social Anthropology at the University of Edinburgh; my area of focus is the anthropology of religion. Most of my work has been on Pentecostal-like forms of American Christianity, where I’ve concentrated my research on what is considered authoritative in communities that, in addition to relying on scripture, also believe members can receive direct individual revelation from God. Over time, though, I’ve become interested in how American religion in general frames issues of authority. I’ve become particularly curious about what are considered reliable sources of religious knowledge, and how religious knowledge interacts with other authoritative discourse, such as science.</p>

              <p>This interest in revelation and in science has led me directly to an interest in the sort of issues that seem to concern much of the MTA as well. Furthermore, the MTA seems to also have a distinct take on this problem, and also has managed to avoid many deadlocks associated with discussion of religion, science, and technology. The MTA is also interesting because these concerns are not merely abstract intellectual problems for most members. Given the educational background and professions of many members of the MTA, these questions appear to have to do with approaches to contemporary technologies as well. Finally, I’ve also become curious as to how the MTA manages to have such a diverse body, which includes not only practicing members of the LDS, but “cultural Mormons,” non-Mormon Christians, and non-Christian members. For these reasons, I’ve proposed a study of the MTA.</p>

              <p>As a socio-cultural anthropologist, studying usually means ‘participant observation,’ which basically means taking part in the same activities and conversations that everyone else in the MTA does. In this case, this means you’ll be seeing me in social media, online forums, and other spaces where much of the MTA virtually ‘meets.’ I’m also interested in interviews with members who would feel comfortable talking with me. Finally, I’m hoping to somewhat regularly come out this summer and fall to Utah, so I can sit in on a few of the meet-ups, and perhaps talk to some of you individually in person.</p>

              <p>I’m sharing this with you for two reasons. First, I want to reach out to as many of you as possible, in the hopes that you’ll feel free to contact me in return (which is best done by email at Jon.Bialecki@ed.ac.uk, though I’m available through other platforms as well). Second, it is important to me that you know in what capacity I’m participating in MTA events. Like a lot of other academic writing, anthropological writing is usually not that controversial, and there is a long-standing practice of anonymizing our data, even when presenting it anecdotally (and as a qualitative social science, narrative is often a large part of how we convey what we have learned). However, most anthropologists feel that it is best practice to let the people you are spending time with know that you’re an anthropologist, and that your presence is at least in part in your capacity as a researcher. It also might explain why I might tend, from time to time, to ask questions that are seemingly obvious – as a non-Mormon who is also still just starting to understand transhumanism, I’m looking forward to learning a great deal from being together with you, but I probably will say things every so often that betrays my ignorance.</p>

              <p>Again, thank you for taking the time to read this, and also for letting me participate in the MTA. I’m very much looking forward to getting to know more about this unique organization!</p>

            <p>June 9</p>
            <p>A Thoughtful Faith podcast interviewed Lincoln Cannon on <a href="http://athoughtfulfaith.org/lincoln-cannon-mormon-transhumanism-becoming-one-body-of-christ/">Mormon Transhumanism and becoming one in the body of Christ</a>.</p>
            <p><em>A Thoughtful Faith</em> features the stories and perspectives of intelligent, thoughtful believers who maintain a strong faith in Mormonism despite their awareness of and/or struggles with common challenges and issues. Its hope is to model potential paths for individuals in faith transition or crisis that allow them to maintain faith, as well as provide resources for thoughtful believers everywhere.</p>
            <p>In the first episode, Lincoln speaks about his personal history, how tragedy shaped his perspectives on God and Faith, and how he came to be passionate about Transhumanism.</p>
            <p>In episode two, Lincoln explores the essence of Transhumanism and how this affects his understanding of God. He also speaks about how it has shaped his deep faith in Mormonism. He explains how he sees Joseph Smith as a transhumanist and addresses our Mormon Transhumanist doctrines.</p>
            <p>In the last episode, Lincoln synthesizes his Christianity and Transhumanism. He talks about the body of Christ and the atonement. He helps us understand our responsibility to become one in the body of Christ.</p>

            <h1>Dorothy Deasy appointed Chief Humanitarian Officer</h1>
            <p>July 11</p>
            <p>The Mormon Transhumanist Association appointed Dorothy Deasy to serve as Chief Humanitarian Officer. Dorothy will continue to serve in her positions as board member and secretary of the board. Humanitarian managers, Hank Pellissier and Roger Hansen, will also continue to serve in their positions.</p>
            <p>The Association engages in humanitarian efforts for a variety of reasons. Partly it is because the projects reflect the motivations and passions of their respective project leaders, such Hank Pellissier's desire to help people in Uganda to reach their potential, Kathy Wilson's hope to ease the hardship of dalits in India, or Roger Hansen's work to bring joy to children growing up in poverty in Africa. The over-arching reason is that we are inspired by the idea of transfiguration and aspire to follow the example of Christ by reaching out with love.</p>
            <p>Dorothy believes that transfiguration calls us both to traditional expressions of charity and to more. Her hope is that the Association will influence many to imagine the promise of transhuman advances and technology as an opportunity to provide greater access to those on the margins, and to position anticipation of the Technological Singularity as an urgent reason for work to ensure that all human potential matters.</p>
            <p>The Mormon Transhumanist Association is eager to work with others on projects that enable people to participate in their own transformation and that of their communities for the better. We need your help, resources, passions, and projects. Join us to ensure emerging technologies are applied where and how they are most needed in our society, culture, and world.</p>

            <p>With host Dan Wotherspoon and Derrick Clements, they explore the difficulties but also the rich blessings of becoming disenchanted, and/or entering into conscious demythologizing. The first part and a bit of the second focus mostly on how this process operates (and could operate better) at a personal level. The second part then folds into a discussion of how Mormonism as an institution might work more effectively to move us into the more powerful experiential realms that can follow upon “brokenness”—whether of symbols, myths, or our hearts.</p>
