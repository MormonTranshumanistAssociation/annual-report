						<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Dear friends and members of the Mormon Transhumanist Association,</p>

<p>Ten years ago, fourteen of us founded this association: Andrew West, Brent Allsop, Cameron Dayton, Carl Youngblood, Cherie West, Chris Bradford, Cory Funk, Gary Parker, Joseph West, Karl Hale, Leonard Reil, Lincoln Cannon, Marcus Flinders, and Martin Wood. Although we hear from some of these founders more often than others, all remain members of the association today.</p>

<p>Since that time, the association has grown to 574 members. I believe that makes us the largest formal organization of religious Transhumanists in the world -- and in human history, for that matter.</p>

<p>More importantly, though, our association has also become a sanctuary for the religious Transhumanist. Mormon and otherwise, we are an uncommon type (so far). That can be lonely. It has been lonely, as frequently expressed by new members when they discover us. But our association changes that.</p>

<p>Many have contributed substantial time and resources to make this happen. Of particular note are those who have served us as board members and managers: Andrew West, Blaire Ostler, Brad Levin, Brent Allsop, Bryant Smith, Carl Youngblood, Chris Bradford, Cory Funk, David Foster, Don Bradley, Dorothy Deasy, James Carroll, Joseph West, Karl Hale, Leonard Reil, Lincoln Cannon, Marcus Flinders, Michael Ferguson, and Nathan Hadfield. They have my gratitude, and I know from abundant feedback that they also have the gratitude of other members of our association.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, I accepted an appointment from our board to serve as president of the association. I have acted in that capacity since that time. And I believe I have done so in a manner that has generally represented us well. Hopefully you will agree, as you look through this annual report, which shares recent opportunities I've had to present some of our ideas and aspirations to large audiences.</p>

<p>Among the challenges presented to leaders of new organizations is that of establishing helpful precedents. Patterns and traditions can be hard to change, for better or worse. With that in mind, I have increasingly felt that the time has come, or perhaps is past due, to establish a leadership change precedent.</p>

<p>I have notified the board that I am retiring from my appointment as president. They and I have been working together on a transition plan for several months. And, in accordance with the process outlined in our constitution, we will appoint a new president in March. Afterwards, I will continue to serve on the board, as elected by voting members.</p>

<p>While I admit to some sadness, this is truly an exciting opportunity for our association. Transhumanists, better than most, know that change is essential to progress. Religious Transhumanists, better than most, know that change is too often most strongly resisted when and where it's needed most.</p>

<p>Thank you, as sincerely as I can express in writing, for your support and friendship over the years. Like many of you, I need this association as my sanctuary. You have made it that for me. And whether we will live forever or die trying, I see Christ in you.</p>

<p>Please enjoy this annual report, which celebrates our work this year, and promises greater works to come.</p>

							<li>We believe that scientific knowledge and technological power are among the means ordained of God to enable such exaltation, including realization of diverse prophetic visions of transfiguration, immortality, resurrection, renewal of this world, and the discovery and creation of worlds without end.</li>

				 		<h1>Performance Review</h1>
             <p>March 11, 2015</p>

             <p><em>In the interest of ongoing transparency, the Board of Directors of the Mormon Transhumanist Association is pleased to release the following leadership performance review. Each member of the Board independently evaluated the performance of the Board as a whole and the performance of CEO Lincoln Cannon, who is appointed by the Board to manage the Association. Secretary of the Board, Dorothy Deasy, gathered and compiled the evaluations into a single review, which follows.</em></p>

             <h2>Board of Directors Performance Review</h2>
             <p>The Board of Directors of the Mormon Transhumanist Association is generally performing its function well. It is comprised of intelligent and compassionate people, who provide good counsel to management on request. It consists of independent, creative, mostly academically-trained thinkers who are able to work together respectfully and articulately toward a consensus on vision, strategy, and policy. There is a diversity of perspectives, including gender, faiths, and sexual orientations, while being able to achieve a unity of directional vision. The Board performs its functions efficiently, with the ability to respectfully and productively disagree, bringing cohesive leadership to the Association.</p>
             <p>This past year, the organization restructured roles, delegating task completion to domain managers. This shifted the focus of the board to be strategic rather than tactical, relieving some time-pressure burdens. The Board is still feeling its way through the transition to produce improved strategic output. This past year the Board established a Humanitarian Projects committee (led by Hank Pellissier and Roger Hansen), developed a policy for moderating discussion forums, worked on guidelines for partnering with other religious transhumanist organizations, began work on a website refresh, and organized an annual conference with strong keynote speakers.</p>
             <p>A key goal for the Board moving forward is to bring clarity and commitment to the strategy-setting role. The Board needs to consider more objective ways of defining and measuring its performance and improvement over time. Another key objective is to better involve and mentor other members of the Association in activities so as to develop leadership for the future.</p>
             <p>The Board meets on a monthly basis. Most Board members attend board meetings regularly. (There are periods of time when scheduling conflicts arise, resulting in some occasional or partial attendance, but we have fairly consistently achieved the quorum required by the constitution.) Meetings are always well organized and focused, and action items are always noted and followed up on until they are completed or reprioritized. The Board adheres closely to the rules and guidelines established by the constitution to ensure fairness, transparency, and fidelity to the stated goals of the Association.</p>
             <p>The requirements of the Board are flexible enough to be satisfied by the part-time involvement of each member, without financial compensation. The Board has done a good job of crafting and supporting Association initiatives on a voluntary basis.</p>

             <h2>CEO's Performance Review</h2>
             <p>Lincoln Cannon is both an inspiring leader and an organized manager. He leads by sharing a vision and then taking practical and consistent steps to carry it out. Lincoln balances near-term goals with ones that are more long-term and speculative. He has a talent for "thinking big" and recognizing the broader implications of current trends. Lincoln excels at thought leadership. He has a gift for articulating complex ideas in ways that are inspiring and easy to understand. He is the public face of the Association and the driving force behind its continued existence, leadership, vision, and passion.</p>
             <p>Lincoln leads by example. He is open and encourages divergent points of view. He is comfortable with ambiguity and nuance. He strives to move people beyond &#8220;black and white&#8221; thinking. As the Association is best served by finding common ground between potentially antagonistic world views, this element of Lincoln's perspective is valuable for the Association. He attempts to weave a middle way through all conflicts.</p>
             <p>As some of the speculative issues related to transhumanism begin to materialize in society, Lincoln may be increasingly challenged to navigate Directors&#8217; viewpoints on ethical issues.</p>
             <p>Some highlights of his leadership include:</p>
             <ul><li>Beginning an effort to identify management partners/successors</li>
             <li>Continued effort to separate strategic role of directors from implementation role of managers</li>
             <li>Ensuring Directors have meaningful responsibilities for which they can be accountable</li>
             <li>Reaching out to prominent leaders of complementary organizations</li>
             <li>Public outreach and publication/presentation to non-Association audiences</li>
             <li>He is the public face of the Association and the driving force behind its continued existence leadership, vision, and passion</li></ul>
             <p>Lincoln&#8217;s key strengths include:</p>
             <ul><li>Vision</li>
             <li>Organization</li>
             <li>Articulate</li>
             <li>Inspirational</li>
             <li>A &#8220;bridge builder,&#8221; able to facilitate relationships</li>
             <li>Patience</li>
             <li>Encouragement</li>
             <li>Strategic, &#8220;big picture&#8221; and long-view perspectives</li>
             </ul>

            <p>March 1</p>

            <p>Members and friends of the association celebrated Future Day by gathering for a screening of <em>AI: Artificial Intelligence</em> at the home of Nathan and Molly Hadfield in Provo, Utah.</p>

            <p>Future Day was first celebrated in 2012 as a way of focusing and celebrating the energy that more and more people around the world are directing toward creating a radically better future. For members of the Mormon Transhumanist Association, this is a great opportunity to share thoughts and questions about a future of radical flourishing in compassion and creation through technology and religion.</p>

            <h1><em>Theology and Science</em> publishes "What is Mormon Transhumanism?"</h1>

            <p>April 17</p>
            <p>The peer reviewed Journal <em>Theology and Science</em> has published "<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14746700.2015.1023992">What is Mormon Transhumanism?</a>" The article was written by Lincoln Cannon, president of the Mormon Transhumanist Association. An abstract of the article follows:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Mormon transhumanism is the idea that humanity should learn how to be compassionate creators. This idea is essential to Mormonism, which provides a religious framework consistent with naturalism and supportive of human transformation. Mormon transhumanists are not limited to traditional or popular accounts of religion, and embrace opportunities and risks of technological evolution. Although usually considered secular, transhumanism has some religious origins and sometimes functions as religion. Accelerating change contextualizes a Mormon transhumanist narrative of common expectations, aspirations, and parallels between Mormonism and transhumanism. Mormon transhumanism has produced secular arguments for faith in God and religious arguments for transhumanism.</p>

            <h1>Religous anthropologist launches study of Mormon Transhumanist Association</h1>
            <p>May 30</p>
            <p>Religious anthropologist <a href="http://jonbialecki.co">Jon Bialecki</a> has launched a study of the Mormon Transhumanist Association, with support of Association leadership. We invite members, friends, critics, and observers of the Association to contribute by welcoming Jon to related discussions and events. You may direct questions to <a href="maito:Jon.Bialecki@ed.ac.uk">Jon</a> or to <a href="mailto:admin@transfigurism.org">Association leadership</a>. Below is a letter of introduction from Jon.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Hello, members of the Mormon Transhumanist Association! I’d like to introduce myself, and also explain why such an introduction might be necessary.</p>

              <p>My name is Jon Bialecki, and I’m a lecturer in Social Anthropology at the University of Edinburgh; my area of focus is the anthropology of religion. Most of my work has been on Pentecostal-like forms of American Christianity, where I’ve concentrated my research on what is considered authoritative in communities that, in addition to relying on scripture, also believe members can receive direct individual revelation from God. Over time, though, I’ve become interested in how American religion in general frames issues of authority. I’ve become particularly curious about what are considered reliable sources of religious knowledge, and how religious knowledge interacts with other authoritative discourse, such as science.</p>

              <p>This interest in revelation and in science has led me directly to an interest in the sort of issues that seem to concern much of the MTA as well. Furthermore, the MTA seems to also have a distinct take on this problem, and also has managed to avoid many deadlocks associated with discussion of religion, science, and technology. The MTA is also interesting because these concerns are not merely abstract intellectual problems for most members. Given the educational background and professions of many members of the MTA, these questions appear to have to do with approaches to contemporary technologies as well. Finally, I’ve also become curious as to how the MTA manages to have such a diverse body, which includes not only practicing members of the LDS, but “cultural Mormons,” non-Mormon Christians, and non-Christian members. For these reasons, I’ve proposed a study of the MTA.</p>

              <p>As a socio-cultural anthropologist, studying usually means ‘participant observation,’ which basically means taking part in the same activities and conversations that everyone else in the MTA does. In this case, this means you’ll be seeing me in social media, online forums, and other spaces where much of the MTA virtually ‘meets.’ I’m also interested in interviews with members who would feel comfortable talking with me. Finally, I’m hoping to somewhat regularly come out this summer and fall to Utah, so I can sit in on a few of the meet-ups, and perhaps talk to some of you individually in person.</p>

              <p>I’m sharing this with you for two reasons. First, I want to reach out to as many of you as possible, in the hopes that you’ll feel free to contact me in return (which is best done by email at Jon.Bialecki@ed.ac.uk, though I’m available through other platforms as well). Second, it is important to me that you know in what capacity I’m participating in MTA events. Like a lot of other academic writing, anthropological writing is usually not that controversial, and there is a long-standing practice of anonymizing our data, even when presenting it anecdotally (and as a qualitative social science, narrative is often a large part of how we convey what we have learned). However, most anthropologists feel that it is best practice to let the people you are spending time with know that you’re an anthropologist, and that your presence is at least in part in your capacity as a researcher. It also might explain why I might tend, from time to time, to ask questions that are seemingly obvious – as a non-Mormon who is also still just starting to understand transhumanism, I’m looking forward to learning a great deal from being together with you, but I probably will say things every so often that betrays my ignorance.</p>

              <p>Again, thank you for taking the time to read this, and also for letting me participate in the MTA. I’m very much looking forward to getting to know more about this unique organization!</p>

            <p>June 9</p>
            <p>A Thoughtful Faith podcast interviewed Lincoln Cannon on <a href="http://athoughtfulfaith.org/lincoln-cannon-mormon-transhumanism-becoming-one-body-of-christ/">Mormon Transhumanism and becoming one in the body of Christ</a>.</p>
            <p><em>A Thoughtful Faith</em> features the stories and perspectives of intelligent, thoughtful believers who maintain a strong faith in Mormonism despite their awareness of and/or struggles with common challenges and issues. Its hope is to model potential paths for individuals in faith transition or crisis that allow them to maintain faith, as well as provide resources for thoughtful believers everywhere.</p>
            <p>In the first episode, Lincoln speaks about his personal history, how tragedy shaped his perspectives on God and Faith, and how he came to be passionate about Transhumanism.</p>
            <p>In episode two, Lincoln explores the essence of Transhumanism and how this affects his understanding of God. He also speaks about how it has shaped his deep faith in Mormonism. He explains how he sees Joseph Smith as a transhumanist and addresses our Mormon Transhumanist doctrines.</p>
            <p>In the last episode, Lincoln synthesizes his Christianity and Transhumanism. He talks about the body of Christ and the atonement. He helps us understand our responsibility to become one in the body of Christ.</p>

            <h1>Dorothy Deasy appointed Chief Humanitarian Officer</h1>
            <p>July 11</p>
            <p>The Mormon Transhumanist Association appointed Dorothy Deasy to serve as Chief Humanitarian Officer. Dorothy will continue to serve in her positions as board member and secretary of the board. Humanitarian managers, Hank Pellissier and Roger Hansen, will also continue to serve in their positions.</p>
            <p>The Association engages in humanitarian efforts for a variety of reasons. Partly it is because the projects reflect the motivations and passions of their respective project leaders, such Hank Pellissier's desire to help people in Uganda to reach their potential, Kathy Wilson's hope to ease the hardship of dalits in India, or Roger Hansen's work to bring joy to children growing up in poverty in Africa. The over-arching reason is that we are inspired by the idea of transfiguration and aspire to follow the example of Christ by reaching out with love.</p>
            <p>Dorothy believes that transfiguration calls us both to traditional expressions of charity and to more. Her hope is that the Association will influence many to imagine the promise of transhuman advances and technology as an opportunity to provide greater access to those on the margins, and to position anticipation of the Technological Singularity as an urgent reason for work to ensure that all human potential matters.</p>
            <p>The Mormon Transhumanist Association is eager to work with others on projects that enable people to participate in their own transformation and that of their communities for the better. We need your help, resources, passions, and projects. Join us to ensure emerging technologies are applied where and how they are most needed in our society, culture, and world.</p>

The second part then folds into a discussion of how Mormonism as an institution might work more effectively to move us into the more powerful experiential realms that can follow upon “brokenness”—whether of symbols, myths, or our hearts.</p>
            <p><a href="http://mormonmatters.org/2015/12/09/312-313-the-positive-spiritual-effects-of-disenchantment-and-demythologizing/">The episodes</a> contain fascinating ethnographic material from Hopi and other cultures, strong exegesis from Paul Tillich and other thinkers, and the participants’ own life stories and experiences with these processes.</p>
